-still having trouble with the data retrieving issue.
	1. initial solution
		-  get the item info/values via store website search
		-  problems: only apply to the store with the search feature
		   (There is no search for Farmboy, soebey and other stores)
	2. new solution
		-  get the item info from weekly flyers
		   (since all the stores have weekly flyers)
		-  difficulty: read data from flyers
		-  a potential problem for items not in the flyers
	3.  alternative Options left
		-  Ask for help (TA)
		-  Change the project
