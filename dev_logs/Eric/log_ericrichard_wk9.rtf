\f0\fs24 \cf0 Week 9\
We spent week 9 thinking about deliverable 4 and more specifically the functionality and features we would want, and need to implement by d4 due date. I spent the time proceeding this to work on creating a more robust geolocating feature along side another group member. We added to the output the travel distance and address of the location in the radius onto of just having the name. }
