\
This week me and another group member finished up all the geolocating features. The rest of our team made a lot of quality of life updates and UI updates to make the app look and feel better. After this we all met and worked on finishing D4 and recording a youtube video and document to be submitted We also discussed the final presentation and the roles associated with it. }
