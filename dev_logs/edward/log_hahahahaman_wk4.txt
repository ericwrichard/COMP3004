- Continued on with the Java application. Realized there were
  numerous issues with this method since not all stores kept data
  on their website, each store had different APIs, and item search
  based on keyword was inaccurate. For example search for eggs
  would give egg noodles, as well as the carton of eggs. 3 hours.

- At group meeting we've decided to just start on the app and to
  simulate the data. 2 hours.
