- Found that Loblaws and Walmart have data on their websites. Built a
  prototype Java application that can scrape data from the sites. 4 hours.

- Met with team. We still don't have a good general solution to
  getting store information. Only Lowblaws and Walmart is not
  particularly useful for a price comparison app. 1 hour.
