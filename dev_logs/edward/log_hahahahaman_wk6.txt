- Created fragments to store different views for the application,
  this is a simple way for the user to change views for different
  things in the application, and I can experiment with how the user
  interacts with different kinds of information. 3 hours.

- Met with group discussed progress and possible new features, such
  as smart search, different categories, and perhaps more things from
  the google maps api. 2 hours.
